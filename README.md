# Minesweeper
Custum Minesweeper Game I wrote for my CSX class

## Usage
Game has to be run with args[0] = size of board and args[1] = bombfile

eg java Minesweeper 8 bombfile.txt

Board size cannot be less than 6 or greater than 30. 
Game defaults to 6 by 6 gameboard if it doesnt meet these parameters

## Rules
User gets 3 hits on a bomb before game is over instead of the traditional 1.

Version 2 will have high scores and connect to a database
